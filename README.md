# Sentiment-Based Trading Bot

This project implements a simple trading bot that uses sentiment analysis to make trading decisions. It fetches news and chat data for a given stock symbol, analyzes the sentiment of that data, and then executes trades based on the sentiment.

## Features

* **Sentiment Analysis:** Uses the Hugging Face Transformers library to analyze the sentiment of news and chat data.
* **Alpaca API Integration:** Connects to the Alpaca trading API to execute trades.
* **Environment Variable Configuration:** Uses environment variables for sensitive information like API keys.
* **Logging:** Implements logging for better monitoring and debugging.

## Prerequisites

Before running the bot, ensure you have the following:

* Python 3.6 or higher
* An Alpaca trading account
* A Hugging Face account (for sentiment analysis)
* Git (for version control)

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd sentiment-trading-bot
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS and Linux
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables:**

    * Create a `.env` file in the project root directory.
    * Add your Alpaca API keys and other configurations to the `.env` file:

        ```
        ALPACA_API_KEY=your_alpaca_api_key
        ALPACA_SECRET_KEY=your_alpaca_secret_key
        ALPACA_BASE_URL=[https://paper-api.alpaca.markets](https://paper-api.alpaca.markets) # or [https://api.alpaca.markets](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://api.alpaca.markets) for live trading.
        TARGET_SYMBOL=AAPL # Replace with your target stock symbol
        TRADE_QUANTITY=10 # Number of shares to trade
        CHECK_INTERVAL=300 # Time in seconds between checks.
        ```

    * Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent committing sensitive data.

5.  **Run the bot:**

    ```bash
    python trading_bot.py
    ```

## Usage

The bot will continuously fetch news and chat data, analyze sentiment, and execute trades based on the configured settings.

* **Configuration:** Modify the environment variables in the `.env` file to customize the bot's behavior.
* **News and Chat Data:** The `fetch_news_and_chat` function is a stub. Replace it with your preferred news and chat data sources.
* **Trading Logic:** The `trade_logic` function implements a simple trading strategy. Enhance it with more sophisticated logic as needed.

## Dependencies

* `alpaca_trade_api`
* `transformers`
* `python-dotenv`
